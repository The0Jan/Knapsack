# Knapsack

Method implementation for problem for "Introduction To Artificial Inteligence" course

A set of N objects with corresponding weights (in kilograms) and values (in zlotys) is given. The maximum capacity of a backpack is given. Find a subset of items that fit in the backpack and have maximum total value. Implement and study a force algorithm for finding the optimal set and a greedy algorithm.  Prepare a sample test set and compare the number of iterations and results of both algorithms for this set.
